The program has now been converted to C++

structs have been converted to class style which have attached methods, Constructors, and destructors


The biggest changes are that the program now uses polymorphism in place of void pointers and that the different types of characters are derived class of GameCharacters.

Moving between maps is also possible in the main build now

Stepping into a gate will send you to the adjacent map tile

There is also a new fly command 

Pressing 'f' on the players turn will allow you to enter in two numbers seperated by a space. If you then press enter you will be sent to the map tile at that location. (The numbers you enter will not be displayed)
    Format - x x
