The Program is now fully playable with the ability to catch pokemon and battle trainers.

Players also now have an inventory with item Pokeballs, potions, and revives as items

Pokemon damage is determined by the given formula but with STAB and type advantage bonues calculated and factored in.
    My Pokemon were doing way to muhc damage so I turned down how high the random numer in the damage calculation was. 

Player's will be given the option to access there inventory during battles by selecting the bag option or can access in the world by pressing 'B'
    It needs to be specifically a capital 'B' as 'b' is mapped for movement

Pokemon will also level up as they gather XP.
    XP is distributed to a players entire team when they win battle
