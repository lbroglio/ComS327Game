The program is now equipped to handle parsing in data from the provided data files.
    The program will search for the data first at /share/cs327/pokedex/pokedex/data/csv/
    If it can't be found there it will check $HOME/.poke327/pokedex/pokedex/data/csv/
    If it can't be found either of those places the program will exit

The program now takes command line arguments in order to know which file to print
    To use the program enter ./poke327 {argument}
    The possible arguments are
        pokemon
        moves
        pokemon moves
        pokemon species
        experience
        type names
        pokemon stats
        stats
        pokemon types
        all
    The first nine arguments all print out the parsed contents of the file of the same name
    all prints out the parsed contents of all of them
