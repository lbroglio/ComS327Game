There are seven types of NPCs

Pacer - Traverse grasslands, roads, and buildings. Moves straight forward until it finds illegal terrain then turns around.

Wanderer - Traverses grasslands, roads, and buildings. Moves randomly but won't leave its spawn biome. (Only spawns in grasslands)

Sentry - Don't move

Explorer - Can traverse grasslands, roads, buildings, and forests. Move randomly

Swimmer- Can only traverse water and bridges. Only spawns in water biomes (Wont spawn in rivers)

Rival- Can traverse grasslands, roads, and buildings. Moves using Dykstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to the player.


Map type dictates amount of each trainer.

Grasslands are evenly distributed 

Forests favor explorers 

Mountains favor hikers 

Lakes heavily favor swimmers
