# This is a game I made over the course of a semester in my course Com S 327

The game is designed as a classic roguelike where the world is drawn using ASCII graphics and features the player exploring a procedurally generated world with the player and the enemies getting stronger as they move further from the start.

The first half of the project was written in C but then the codebase was converted to C++ which was used to complete the rest of the game.

## Features

### Map Generation

The game world is a 400 x 400 grid of randomly generated tiles. The tiles are generated by placing biome tiles at random points on them and then growing them outward by expanding them each by one each round and stopping when they run into each other. Then any roads, buildings, and rivers are placed on top of the map.

### Enemy AI

On every map tile there will be trainers who will battle the player if they are ever on the same tile. Every trainer has a specific type which determines their behavior.
- 


In the game you can explore a randomly generated map while catching, levelling up, and battling with many different Pokemon.
Map tiles feature a variety of biomes and certain maptiles can favor different landscapes.
The game is written in C++ with the use of the ncurses library to make in playable in the terminal.

## How to play

### Compile and Run

Compile the game using the provided Makefile by typing 'make' into the terminal of a machine with Make and GCC installed.
This will produce the poke327 executable file which can be run with ./poke327

### Controls

You can control the game with the standard Roguelike controls or the Numpad
The controls map as:
    7 or y - Move diagnolly to the upper left space
    8 or k - Move up one space
    9 or u - Move diagnolly to the upper right space
    6 or l - Move one space to the right.
    3 or n - Move diagnolly to the lower right space.
    2 or j - Move up one space.
    1 or b - Move diagnolly to the lower left.
    4 or h - Move one space to the left 
    > - If on a building (Building's are represented with eother a 'C' or an 'M') enter the building
    < - Exit a building 
    5 or spacebar or . - Rest for a turn. NPCs still move.
    t - Display a list of trainers on the map and their position relative to the player
        The list can be scrolled with the up and down arrows. Exit the list with the 'esc' key
    Q Quit the game.
