This program randomly generates a map for a pokemone like game. It places the origin points of several biomes on the map with 
extra weight being given to a specific primary biome. 

There are 5 different biomes. . is shorts grassm : is tall grass, " is trees/forest, 
~ is water, % is rocks/mountains. Mountains and Waters can be added in two ways. As rivers and mountain ranges (Lines across the map) or as standard biomes.

After that buildings are added. Pokemon centers and Pokemarts are added to the origin points of short grass biomes.

Then roads are added. The roads are first drawn out from the two side entrances and exits and meet at a random point. 
Then roads are to the two buildings with checks to make sure the roads don't hit them at any point.
Roads are represented by two symbols. # is a normal road, = is a bridge over water
